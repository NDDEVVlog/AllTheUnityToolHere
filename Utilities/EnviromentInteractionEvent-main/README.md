### Attach the ObjectInfo Script to the GameObject

Then, Attach the _**ObjectInfo**_ script to the gameobject you want.
The _**ObjectInfo**_ script allows you to assign the material, sound, and particle effects to the GameObject. This is especially useful for adding specific properties and effects.

### Read and Understand MovementSound and EnvironmentInteractionEvent Scripts

Ensure you thoroughly read and comprehend the **_MovementSound_** and **_EnvironmentInteractionEvent_** scripts. These scripts are crucial for managing sound effects and environmental interactions in your game.

_**MovementSound**_: This script demonstrates how to implement sound effects for object movement. Make sure to study this example to understand how to extend or modify it for your needs.
_**EnvironmentInteractionEvent**_: This script manages interactions between objects and the environment, including triggering sound and particle effects when interactions occur.
